Given a Lie group action that generates transport\nalong the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie\ngroup via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding\nLie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the\nstochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to\nthe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in\nthe manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their\ndeterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration\nschemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying\nordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a\ntruncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group\nintegrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary\ndifferential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are\nuniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.\nLastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid\nbody such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by\ntwo independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Mar 2007 11:05:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2007 10:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-16","authors_parsed":[["Malham","Simon J.

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades.

We argue\nthat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that\ninitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation\ndriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the\nobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central\nconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in\nwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by\n-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known\ninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal\n``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant\nvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven\ncluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.\nOur conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend\ninstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal\nradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative\nprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties\n(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as\nrho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF\nimplies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values\n(although falling towards the low end of this range).

In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial\nfields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell\npp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal\nsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to\nthe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results\ncan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also\nstudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In\nparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse\nspace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition\nrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive\nmodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this\nsimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on\nthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an\niterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT\nequations of motion has been discussed.

For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination\nchange is, in any case, very small.

It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks\nat wavevectors $q=a\\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero\nmagnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization\nplateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\\pi /3$ and\n$4\\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the\nzero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear\nsuperposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is\nobserved that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of\nthe system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the\nsusceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the\npeak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the\ncouplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings\nleads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition,\nthe experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization\nfor the compound Cu$_{3}$(CO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(OH)$_{2}$ are fairly compared with\nour TMRG results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2007 09:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13","authors_parsed":[["Gu","Bo",""],["Su","Gang",""]]}
