Entanglement is at the\nheart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for\napplications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,\nentanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs\nA1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-State\nMeasurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled\nstate, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common\npast[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],\nbut here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,\nas originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp\nsynchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the\ncoherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,\nexceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be\nreplaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing\nfor the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment\nexploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the\nefficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear\ncrystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is\nindependent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled\nphotons[9] at telecom wavelengths.

For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a\nquantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,\nthe corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products\nof system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of\nthe quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable.

For many decades\nsurveys have been the backbone of astronomy, and the main engine of discovery,\nas we have mapped the sky at every possible wavelength. Surveys are an\nefficient use of resources. They are important as a fundamental resource; to\nmap intrinsically large structures; to gain the necessary statistics to address\nsome problems; and to find very rare objects. I summarise major recent wide\nfield surveys - 2MASS, SDSS, 2dfGRS, and UKIDSS - and look at examples of the\nexciting science they have produced, covering the structure of the Milky Way,\nthe measurement of cosmological parameters, the creation of a new field\nstudying substellar objects, and the ionisation history of the Universe. I then\nlook briefly at upcoming projects in the optical-IR survey arena - VISTA,\nPanSTARRS, WISE, and LSST. Finally I ask, now we have opened up essentially all\nwavelength windows, whether the exploration of survey discovery space is ended.\nI examine other possible axes of discovery space, and find them mostly to be\ntoo expensive to explore or otherwise unfruitful, with two exceptions : the\nfirst is the time axis, which we have only just begun to explore properly; and\nthe second is the possibility of neutrino astrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2007 21:45:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13","authors_parsed":[["Lawrence","A.",""]]}

We have detected the red giant branch bump\nfor the first time, although it is at least 0.2 mag fainter than expected\nrelative to the turnoff. The number of red giants (relative to main sequence\nturnoff stars) is in excellent agreement with stellar models from the\nYonsei-Yale and Teramo groups, and slightly high compared to Victoria-Regina\nmodels. This adds to evidence that an abnormally large ratio of red giant to\nmain-sequence stars is not correlated with cluster metallicity. We discuss\ntheoretical predictions from different research groups and find that the\ninclusion or exclusion of helium diffusion and strong limit Coulomb\ninteractions may be partly responsible.\n  We also examine indicators of dynamical history: the mass function exponent\nand the blue straggler frequency. NGC 5466 has a very shallow mass function,\nconsistent with large mass loss and recently-discovered tidal tails. The blue\nstraggler sample is significantly more centrally concentrated than the HB or\nRGB stars. We see no evidence of an upturn in the blue straggler frequency at\nlarge distances from the center.

Here we show that these stars most likely lost their\nenvelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf\npopulation in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population\nsynthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the\nbinary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot\nsubdwarfs in our Galaxy.

We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic\ntools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for\nunderstanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in\ngeneral.

One\nof the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced\nvariability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic\nvariability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth.

Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed\nin complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength\nimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the\non-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this\nprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises\nmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is\ncharacterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small\nclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization\nbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of\nsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and\nseparation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical\nproperties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,\nand some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few\nactive nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are\nindependent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation\ntypes. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional\nunderstandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some\nreal problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the\nunsynchronizable state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2007 14:19:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23","authors_parsed":[["Wang","Xingang",""],["Zhan","Meng",""],["Guan","Ghuguang",""],["Lai","Choy Heng",""]]}
